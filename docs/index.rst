xmi
=======================================

xmi is a python library developed to handle NETDATA (XMI) and virtual
tape files (AWS and HET). It was developed to open and extract (unload)
XMI/AWS/HET mainframe files.

Overview
------------------

Below are links to the ``xmi`` python library documentation. XMI/AWS/HET files
were poorly documented with information scattered throughout IBM, CBT Tape, and
elsewhere. The sections *Understanding XMI Files*, *Understanding Virtual Tapes*
and *IEBCOPY File Format* describe the file structure of each.
